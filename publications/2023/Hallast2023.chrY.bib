  abstract  = "The prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within the human Y
               chromosome has prevented its complete assembly to date1 and led
               to its systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here we
               present de novo assemblies of 43 Y chromosomes spanning 182,900
               years of human evolution and report considerable diversity in
               size and structure. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region
               is subject to large inversions with a greater than twofold
               higher recurrence rate compared with all other chromosomes2.
               Ampliconic sequences associated with these inversions show
               differing mutation rates that are sequence context dependent,
               and some ampliconic genes exhibit evidence for concerted
               evolution with the acquisition and purging of lineage-specific
               pseudogenes. The largest heterochromatic region in the human
               genome, Yq12, is composed of alternating repeat arrays that show
               extensive variation in the number, size and distribution, but
               retain a 1:1 copy-number ratio. Finally, our data suggest that
               the boundary between the recombining pseudoautosomal region 1
               and the non-recombining portions of the X and Y chromosomes lies
               500 kb away from the currently established1 boundary. The
               availability of fully sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from
               multiple individuals provides a unique opportunity for
               identifying new associations of traits with specific
               Y-chromosomal variants and garnering insights into the evolution
               and function of complex regions of the human genome.",
