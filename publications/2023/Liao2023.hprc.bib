  abstract  = "Here the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium presents a first
               draft of the human pangenome reference. The pangenome contains
               47 phased, diploid assemblies from a cohort of genetically
               diverse individuals1. These assemblies cover more than 99\% of
               the expected sequence in each genome and are more than 99\%
               accurate at the structural and base pair levels. Based on
               alignments of the assemblies, we generate a draft pangenome that
               captures known variants and haplotypes and reveals new alleles
               at structurally complex loci. We also add 119 million base pairs
               of euchromatic polymorphic sequences and 1,115 gene duplications
               relative to the existing reference GRCh38. Roughly 90 million of
               the additional base pairs are derived from structural variation.
               Using our draft pangenome to analyse short-read data reduced
               small variant discovery errors by 34\% and increased the number
               of structural variants detected per haplotype by 104\% compared
               with GRCh38-based workflows, which enabled the typing of the
               vast majority of structural variant alleles per sample.",
