# Core Unit Bioinformatics

Welcome to the GitHub profile of the Core Unit Bioinformatics (CUBI) of the
[Medical Faculty](https://www.medizin.hhu.de/en/) of the
[Heinrich Heine University](https://www.hhu.de/en/) Düsseldorf (Germany).

# Our mission

The CUBI offers bioinformatic expertise and analysis support for all researchers at the HHU. We are your scientific partners, starting from initial
project counseling, to data clean-up, reproducible data processing and in-depth evaluation of the results. The service catalog of the CUBI builds
on the work of the global bioinformatics and open source community. We do our part in giving back to the community by writing clean and reusable
analysis workflows that are publicly available under a permissive license and deployable in standardized ways.

# Our services

(The CUBI service catalog is currently being compiled)
